# traffic-flow-project
The purpose of this project is to get my feet wet in software engineering and ultimately have a working four-way stop intersection with correct traffic flow. I would like the user to be able to put a car into a certain spot throughout the intersection, and initiate a sequence that will display the correct flow of traffic.
